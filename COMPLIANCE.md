# ClaudeSec Compliance & Controls Mapping

> **Status of this document.** ClaudeSec is open-source software, not a certified or
> audited product. Nothing here claims that ClaudeSec is "compliant with" or "certified
> against" any framework. ClaudeSec is **self-hosted software that a deployer runs inside
> their own environment**. This document explains which technical controls ClaudeSec
> *provides* and *supports*, and — just as importantly — which controls remain the
> **deployer's responsibility**. Certification is achieved by an organization's overall
> control environment, of which a tool is only one part.

## 1. Overview

ClaudeSec is a self-hosted, local-first security-observability tool for AI coding agents
(Claude Code, GitHub Copilot CLI, Codex, and any OpenTelemetry/OTLP-emitting agent). It
ingests agent activity, evaluates each span against ~630 deterministic threat-detection
rules, persists spans to a local SQLite database, streams them to a local dashboard, and
can optionally **enforce** (block) tool calls before they run.

Because ClaudeSec observes sensitive material — your agents' commands, prompts, and file
contents — it is designed to be **local-first by construction**: it binds to loopback by
default, performs no outbound calls unless explicitly configured, scrubs secrets before
storage, and ships no telemetry to its authors.

This document is intended for security and compliance reviewers evaluating ClaudeSec for
use in a regulated environment. It maps ClaudeSec's features to widely used control
frameworks and is explicit about the boundary between what the tool does and what the
deploying organization must still implement.

**Scope of evidence.** Every control claim below references a feature that exists in the
public repository. Primary references:
[`README.md`](README.md),
[`.github/SECURITY.md`](.github/SECURITY.md),
[`.env.example`](.env.example),
[`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml),
[`openapi.yaml`](openapi.yaml),
the CI workflows under [`.github/workflows/`](.github/workflows),
and the server modules under [`server/`](server) (notably `scrub.ts`, `ssrf.ts`,
`detection.ts`, `db.ts`).

## 2. Shared-Responsibility Model

ClaudeSec is unmanaged software. There is no ClaudeSec-operated service, no cloud
backend, and no data egress to its authors. As a result, the operational and governance
controls in any framework belong to the **deployer**. The split is summarized below.

| Area | ClaudeSec provides | Deployer must implement |
|---|---|---|
| **Hosting & data residency** | Runs entirely on hardware the deployer controls; SQLite stays on local disk | Choose and secure the host; meet residency/sovereignty requirements |
| **Network exposure** | Binds `127.0.0.1` by default; refuses to bind a non-loopback host without a token or explicit `CLAUDESEC_TRUST_LOCAL=1` | TLS termination, reverse proxy, VPN/firewall, network segmentation for any non-local exposure |
| **Authentication** | Optional bearer token (`CLAUDESEC_TOKEN`) gating non-loopback API/MCP/OTLP access | SSO/MFA, identity lifecycle, and access reviews at the network/identity layer |
| **Data at rest** | DB file created `0600` (owner-only); secret scrubbing before persistence | Disk/volume encryption (full-disk, LUKS, or equivalent); filesystem ACLs; backup protection |
| **Data minimization & retention** | Secret/PII scrubbing on by default; count- and age-based pruning (`CLAUDESEC_MAX_SPANS`, `CLAUDESEC_RETENTION_DAYS`) | Set retention to match policy; document lawful basis; honor data-subject requests |
| **Detection content** | ~630 maintained rules + custom-rule CRUD; honeytokens; optional MCP/skill scanner | Tune rules to environment; triage alerts; integrate with SIEM/incident process |
| **Enforcement** | Opt-in PreToolUse hook + cross-agent MCP proxy; `monitor` default, `enforce` available | Decide policy; understand fail-open scope; layer an OS sandbox for hard isolation |
| **Governance** | Audit-quality event logs and reporting to feed a program | Policies, risk register, roles/accountability, training, vendor management, audits |

> **Read this first:** [`.github/SECURITY.md`](.github/SECURITY.md) states plainly that
> ClaudeSec ships **no authentication, no TLS, and no encryption at rest by default**. Those
> are deliberate consequences of the local-first design and are the deployer's
> responsibility to add for any non-local or regulated deployment. This document does not
> contradict that — it explains how the tool's controls *support* the deployer in closing
> those gaps.

## 3. Framework Mapping

Mappings use the verbs **"maps to," "supports," and "helps satisfy."** They never assert
"compliant" or "satisfies in full." Each row separates the tool-provided control from the
deployer obligation. Control identifiers are taken from the published frameworks.

### 3.1 SOC 2 (AICPA Trust Services Criteria)

| TSC | Criterion | How ClaudeSec supports it | Deployer still owns |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CC6.1** | Logical access security measures | Loopback-only default bind; **bind-refusal guard** that exits rather than expose a non-loopback host without a token; optional `CLAUDESEC_TOKEN`; `0600` DB file | MFA/SSO, identity store, password policy, privileged-access management |
| **CC6.6** | Access restricted from external threats | No egress by default; the only outbound paths (`OTEL_FORWARD_URL`, `CLAUDESEC_JUDGE_URL`) are off unless set and pass an SSRF guard | Network segmentation, IDS/IPS, perimeter controls |
| **CC6.7** | Transmission of data protected | Optional bearer-token auth on remote API/OTLP; SSRF guard blocks egress to private/loopback/metadata ranges | **TLS in transit** (terminate at a reverse proxy) — not provided by the tool |
| **CC7.1** | Vulnerability & malware detection | ~630 threat rules covering credential theft, reverse shells, supply-chain attacks, exfiltration, cloud-metadata SSRF, container escape; MCP/skill static scanner | Endpoint EDR, host vulnerability scanning, patch cadence |
| **CC7.2** | Monitoring for security events | Real-time span ingestion + live alerting; Prometheus `/metrics`; webhook delivery of HIGH alerts; honeytokens | Central SIEM, alert triage SLAs, on-call rotation |
| **CC7.3 / CC7.4** | Incident evaluation, containment & response | Per-session security reports (`cli/init.mjs report`); enforcement hook/proxy can block a tool call before it runs (`enforce` mode) | Documented IR plan, runbooks, post-incident reviews |
| **CC8.1** | Authorized, tested changes | The project's own SDLC: SHA-pinned GitHub Actions, `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, type-check + build gates, ReDoS rule self-test gate as a `prebuild` step | The deployer's own change-management process |

### 3.2 ISO/IEC 27001:2022 (Annex A)

| Annex A | Control | How ClaudeSec supports it | Deployer still owns |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A.8.11** | Data masking | **Secret scrubbing** (`server/scrub.ts`): keys, tokens, JWTs, cloud credentials, home paths, usernames, and emails are redacted before anything is stored, broadcast, or exported (on by default) | Classification scheme; verifying masking meets policy (scrubbing is best-effort regex) |
| **A.8.12** | Data leakage prevention | Honeytokens fire a HIGH exfiltration alert on any match; exfiltration rules in the detection set | Enterprise DLP, egress monitoring |
| **A.8.15** | Logging | Every span persisted with nanosecond timing; structured, queryable audit trail of tool calls, commands, and file access | Log retention policy, tamper-evidence, time-source governance |
| **A.8.16** | Monitoring activities | Continuous evaluation of every span against the rule set; live anomaly surfacing and alerting | SOC processes, correlation across other sources |
| **A.8.23** | Web filtering / egress control | SSRF guard (`server/ssrf.ts`) DNS-resolves targets at call time and allows only globally-routable unicast addresses — blocking loopback, private, link-local, and `169.254.169.254` metadata; re-resolves on every request to defeat DNS rebinding | Proxy/filtering at the network layer |
| **A.8.25 / A.8.28** | Secure development lifecycle / secure coding | CodeQL static analysis (weekly + on PR), `pnpm audit --prod`, RE2/linear-time regex compilation for ReDoS safety, ReDoS self-test gate | Applies to the *project*; deployer runs own SDLC for its systems |
| **A.5.23** | Information security for cloud services | Local-first by construction; no third-party cloud dependency unless the deployer adds one | Cloud-provider due diligence if hosted in cloud |
| **A.8.10** | Information deletion | Age- and count-based pruning (`CLAUDESEC_RETENTION_DAYS`, `CLAUDESEC_MAX_SPANS`); `POST /api/reset` is disabled unless `CLAUDESEC_ALLOW_RESET=1` | Deletion policy, certificate-of-destruction processes |

### 3.3 AI Governance — NIST AI RMF 1.0, ISO/IEC 42001:2023, EU AI Act

> **Positioning, stated plainly.** ClaudeSec is **not itself a high-risk AI system** and is
> **not a GPAI model**. Its detection engine is **deterministic regular-expression matching**.
> The only generative component — the optional LLM-as-judge — is **off by default**, runs
> locally, and makes zero network calls unless explicitly configured. ClaudeSec is an
> **instrument that helps a deploying organization govern the AI agents *it* operates**. The
> AI Management System (AIMS), policies, risk tolerance, and accountability structures are
> the **deployer's** responsibility; ClaudeSec provides the operational monitoring,
> record-keeping, and oversight tooling that those programs require.

**NIST AI RMF 1.0**

| Subcategory | Function | How ClaudeSec supports it | Deployer still owns |
|---|---|---|---|
| **MEASURE — MS-3.1 / MS-3.2** | AI risk tracked over time | Continuous post-deployment monitoring of agent behavior; per-session health scoring surfaces degradation and anomalous activity | Defining metrics/thresholds; periodic review cadence |
| **MEASURE — MS-2.4** | Security & privacy assessed | Detection of credential theft, exfiltration, prompt-injection patterns in agent activity; MCP/skill scanner | Formal pre-deployment evaluation of the deployer's AI systems |
| **MANAGE — MG-2.3** | Emergency interventions | `enforce` mode + always-on catastrophic floor (e.g. `rm -rf /`, fork bombs, piped RCE) act as a tool-call-level intervention; process scanner can pause/kill agents | A real "kill switch" / org-level shutdown authority |
| **MANAGE — MG-3.2** | AI incidents documented & investigated | Persistent span store + per-session security reports + webhook alerting provide an incident evidence trail | Incident log, severity classification, post-incident review |
| **GOVERN — GV-1.x / GV-4.x** | Policies, cross-functional escalation | (Tool provides evidence inputs only) | **Deployer obligation** — policies, accountability, escalation paths are organizational, not tool features |

**ISO/IEC 42001:2023 (Annex A)**

| Control | Name | How ClaudeSec supports it | Deployer still owns |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A.6.2.6** | AI system operation and monitoring | Real-time, continuous monitoring of AI agent operations with alerting on anomalies | Defining alert thresholds and remediation processes |
| **A.6.2.8** | AI system recording of event logs | Durable, queryable event logs of every agent tool call sufficient for incident investigation and audit | Log retention periods and access controls per policy |
| **A.8.4** | Communication of incidents | Webhook delivery of HIGH-severity alerts to Slack/Discord/JSON endpoints; per-session reports | Notification thresholds, regulatory/affected-party reporting |
| **A.9.2** | Processes for responsible use of AI systems | Enforcement layer can gate agent tool calls against an acceptable-use rule set (`monitor`/`enforce`) | The acceptable-use policy itself and human-oversight procedures |
| **A.2.2 / A.3.2 / A.5.2** | AI policy, roles, impact assessment | (Deployer obligation) | **Deployer owns** the AIMS, policy, RACI, and AI impact assessments |

**EU AI Act**

| Reference | Topic | How ClaudeSec relates | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Art. 6 / Annex III** | High-risk classification | ClaudeSec is **not** an Annex III high-risk use case and is **not** a safety component under Annex I | It is a developer security tool, not a system making decisions about people |
| **Art. 26** | Deployer obligations (human oversight, monitoring, log-keeping) | ClaudeSec **supports a deployer** in meeting monitoring and automatically-generated-log retention duties for high-risk AI systems they operate | The legal obligation remains the deployer's |
| **Art. 50** | Transparency for AI interaction / generated content | Relevant only if the optional local LLM-judge is enabled; its output is internal classification, not user-facing generated content | Off by default; deployer assesses applicability if enabled |
| **Art. 3 (GPAI)** | GPAI model obligations | **Not applicable** — ClaudeSec trains and ships no model | — |

### 3.4 Privacy — GDPR

> **Role determination.** The ClaudeSec project operates no service and receives no data
> (no telemetry-home, no egress by default). Therefore the **ClaudeSec project is neither a
> controller nor a processor**; the **deploying organization is the sole data controller**
> for any personal data its agents' activity contains. There is no processor relationship,
> so **no Data Processing Agreement applies** between the deployer and the ClaudeSec authors.

| Article | Requirement | How ClaudeSec supports it | Deployer still owns |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Art. 25** | Data protection by design & by default | Loopback-default bind, no egress by default, and **secret/PII scrubbing on by default** are privacy-protective defaults | Configuring the deployment to its risk profile |
| **Art. 32** | Security of processing | `0600` DB permissions; SSRF egress guard; pseudonymization of identifiers via scrubbing | **Encryption at rest and in transit** (not provided), access control, breach detection |
| **Art. 5(1)(c)** | Data minimization | Scrubbing removes secrets, home paths, usernames, and email local-parts before storage | Deciding which spans/attributes are necessary |
| **Art. 5(1)(e)** | Storage limitation | Configurable age- and count-based retention; automatic pruning | Setting retention to match policy; documenting it |
| **Art. 17** | Right to erasure | `POST /api/reset` (gated by `CLAUDESEC_ALLOW_RESET`) and pruning provide deletion mechanisms | Operationalizing data-subject request handling |
| **Art. 30 / 35** | RoPA, DPIA | (Deployer obligation) | **Deployer owns** records of processing and any DPIA |

> **Honest limitation.** Secret/PII scrubbing is **best-effort pattern matching**. It
> redacts known secret shapes and identifiers but cannot guarantee removal of every
> sensitive value an agent may emit. At-rest data is **not encrypted** by the tool. Treat
> the database as sensitive and apply disk encryption and filesystem controls accordingly.

### 3.5 CIS Controls v8

## 4. Data Handling & Privacy

- **What data is processed.** OpenTelemetry spans describing AI-agent activity: tool
  names, command lines, file paths, and (when enhanced telemetry is enabled) prompts and
  arguments. This material **may contain secrets or personal data** by nature.
- **Where it lives.** A single local SQLite database (`spans.db`), created with `0600`
  (owner-only) permissions, plus optional hourly JSON snapshots in `exports/`. Nothing is
  stored off the host.
- **Secret & PII scrubbing.** On by default. Before any span is persisted, broadcast, or
  exported, `server/scrub.ts` redacts known secret formats (API keys, tokens, JWTs, cloud
  credentials, private keys), home directory paths, OS usernames, and the local-part of
  email addresses. Disable only with `CLAUDESEC_DISABLE_SCRUB=1`. Scrubbing is best-effort.
- **Retention.** `CLAUDESEC_MAX_SPANS` (count-based) and `CLAUDESEC_RETENTION_DAYS`
  (age-based) prune old data automatically; defaults are 50,000 spans and 30 days.
- **Deletion.** Pruning is automatic; full wipe via `POST /api/reset` is **disabled by
  default** and requires `CLAUDESEC_ALLOW_RESET=1` to prevent accidental data loss.
- **No telemetry-home.** ClaudeSec sends nothing to its authors. The only outbound paths
  are operator-configured (`OTEL_FORWARD_URL`, `CLAUDESEC_JUDGE_URL`, `CLAUDESEC_WEBHOOK_URL`),
  off unless set, and SSRF-guarded where applicable.

---

## 5. Security Controls

- **Network & authentication.** Binds `127.0.0.1` by default. A **bind-refusal guard**
  refuses to start on a non-loopback host unless `CLAUDESEC_TOKEN` is set or
  `CLAUDESEC_TRUST_LOCAL=1` is explicitly chosen. When set, the token gates all
  non-loopback API, MCP, and OTLP access (bearer header, `x-api-key`, or query token).
- **SSRF guard.** All operator-configured outbound fetches pass through `server/ssrf.ts`,
  which requires http/https, **DNS-resolves the target at call time**, and allows only
  globally-routable unicast addresses — transparently blocking loopback, private,
  link-local, CGNAT, and `169.254.169.254` cloud-metadata ranges, and defeating DNS
  rebinding by re-resolving on every request.
- **Data at rest.** DB file is `0600`. The tool does **not** encrypt at rest; pair with
  disk/volume encryption.
- **Container hardening.** The Docker image runs as the non-root `node` user (via
  `su-exec`) and publishes the host port on `127.0.0.1` only.
- **Supply chain & CI.** GitHub Actions are **pinned by commit SHA**; `pnpm install
  --frozen-lockfile` enforces the lockfile; `pnpm audit --prod --audit-level high` gates
  the build; CodeQL runs on every PR and weekly; Dependabot tracks npm and GitHub-Actions
  updates weekly; CI fails if any database file is accidentally tracked.
- **Detection-engine safety.** Custom rules compile with RE2 (linear-time, ReDoS-safe); a
  rule self-test gate (`tests/ruleSelfTest.ts`) enforces ReDoS heuristics, a deduplication
  check, and a false-positive gate, and runs as a `prebuild` step so a bad rule fails the
  build.
- **Enforcement, honestly scoped.** The PreToolUse hook and MCP proxy are an
  **agent-specific** enforcement layer, **not an OS sandbox**. Both **fail open**: any
  error, missing config, or unparseable input results in *allow*. The hook is bypassable
  (`CLAUDESEC_HOOKS_BYPASS=1`).

---

## 6. Industry-Specific Frameworks

These regimes regulate the **deploying organization**, not ClaudeSec. ClaudeSec provides
controls that *support* a deployer's program; it does not by itself confer compliance.

- **HIPAA (US healthcare).** ClaudeSec supports the Security Rule's audit-controls
  (§164.312(b)) and information-system-activity-review (§164.308(a)(1)(ii)(D)) expectations
  by logging and monitoring agent activity. **Deployer must** execute Business Associate
  Agreements with any third parties, encrypt ePHI at rest and in transit (not provided by
  the tool), and govern access. Do not feed unscrubbed ePHI into spans.
- **PCI DSS (payment cards).** Supports Requirement 10 (logging and monitoring of access)
  and Requirement 6 secure-development expectations via the project's SDLC. **Deployer
  must** handle network segmentation (Req. 1), encryption (Req. 3/4), and access control
  (Req. 7/8). ClaudeSec must not store cardholder data; scrubbing reduces but does not
  guarantee removal.
- **FedRAMP / NIST SP 800-53 (US government).** Maps conceptually to the AU (Audit &
  Accountability) and SI (System & Information Integrity) families through logging,
  monitoring, and detection. **Deployer must** operate the full authorization boundary,
  control inheritance, and continuous-monitoring program; the tool is one inheritable
  control source, not an ATO.

## 7. Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues responsibly via the process in
[`.github/SECURITY.md`](.github/SECURITY.md) — GitHub Security Advisories (preferred) or
direct maintainer contact. **Do not open a public issue for a vulnerability.** Reports are
acknowledged within 48 hours, with a target fix window of 7 days for critical issues, under
a coordinated-disclosure process.
