# ClaudeSec — one command to run it.
#
# Two audiences, both zero-config (no .env file required):
#
#   ./start.sh            Local (humans): clone -> running dashboard in one
#                         command. Tails your on-disk agent transcripts live
#                         and tells you which agents it can see.
#
#   ./start.sh --docker   Docker (servers): runs `docker compose up` (headless).
#                         Docker ingests via OTLP only — it cannot read your
#                         machine's transcripts, so there is no local watching.
#
#   ./start.sh --demo     Docker + demo: runs `docker compose --profile demo up`,
#                         bringing up BOTH the prod container (:3000) and a
#                         separate demo container (:3001) pre-seeded with
#                         synthetic data on its own isolated volume — handy for
#                         showing the tool without exposing real telemetry.
#
# Why a shell script (not the existing `claudesec` CLI): the CLI installs a
# background OS service; this script is the friendlier "clone and go" path that
# runs the dashboard in the foreground and explains what it can see. It stays
# shell-only so a brand-new user needs nothing but bash to get started.

set -euo pipefail

# --- Always operate from the repo root -------------------------------------
# Every later step (node_modules check, pnpm install, pnpm dev, docker compose)
# assumes the current directory is the repo root. Resolve the script's own
# directory and cd into it so `./start.sh` works no matter where it's invoked.

ClaudeSec — start the local security observatory for your AI coding agents.

USAGE:
  ./start.sh            Run the full local dashboard (zero-config).
                        Installs deps if needed, shows which agents are
                        detected, opens http://localhost:3000, and tails your
                        Claude Code / Codex / Copilot CLI transcripts live.

  ./start.sh --docker   Run via Docker (`docker compose up`, headless).
                        Docker ingests via OTLP only — no local-transcript
                        watching (the container can't see your machine's files).

  ./start.sh --demo     Run via Docker with the demo container too
                        (`docker compose --profile demo up`). Brings up BOTH the
                        prod container on :3000 and a separate demo container on
                        :3001. The demo container is pre-seeded with synthetic
                        data on its OWN volume — physically isolated from your
                        real data — so you can show the tool to others safely.

  ./start.sh --help     Show this help.

Requires Node.js >= 22.13 and pnpm (enabled automatically via corepack) for the
local path, or Docker for the --docker path. No environment variables needed.
